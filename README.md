Utilized the NBA Stats API to access player statistics for different seasons, including points per game, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, turnovers, and shooting percentages.

## Analysis and Prediction of LeBron James' Regular Season Performance

In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of LeBron James' regular season statistics to understand performance trends and predict missing data points. Key components of this project include:

Aggregating and preprocessing LeBron James' game statistics from 2010 to 2023.
Analyzing trends in various performance metrics such as games played, minutes, points, assists, rebounds, steals, blocks, turnovers, field goal percentage, three-point percentage, and free throw percentage.
Handling missing data for the years 2018-2019 and 2020-2023 using machine learning techniques.
Implementing the Facebook Prophet model to predict missing values in points and other statistics.
Visualizing the trends and predictions using Matplotlib to provide clear and informative graphical representations.
This project showcases my expertise in data preprocessing, time series analysis, and predictive modeling, as well as my ability to present complex data insights in an accessible and professional manner.
